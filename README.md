# Java Design Patterns - 23 Patterns with Examples

This repository provides implementations of the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Java, along with real-world examples and explanations. These patterns are widely used in software development to promote reusable, maintainable, and scalable code.

## About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jingnan Hu, a passionate software developer with a strong interest in design patterns, clean code principles, and scalable architecture. Over the years, I have worked on diverse projects, honing my skills in Java and exploring the nuances of software design.

This repository is a culmination of my efforts to deeply understand and apply the 23 design patterns described in the classic *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* by the Gang of Four (GoF). I hope it serves as a valuable resource for developers at all levels.
