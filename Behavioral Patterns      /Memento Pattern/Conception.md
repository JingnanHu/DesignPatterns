### **Memento Pattern**

#### **Definition**
The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture an object's internal state and save it outside the object without breaking its encapsulation. This saved state can later be restored to revert the object to its previous state.

---

#### **Advantages**
1. **State Restoration**: Provides a way to restore an object to a previous state, enabling undo or rollback functionality.
2. **Encapsulation**: The object's internal state is hidden from external classes, ensuring the integrity of its data.

---

#### **Disadvantages**
1. **Memory Consumption**: If the object has many attributes or the state changes frequently, saving states can consume significant memory.
2. **Complex Management**: Managing a large number of saved states (mementos) can increase complexity.

---

#### **Use Cases**
1. **Saving and Restoring Data**: For example, implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors or saving game progress in applications.
2. **Rollback Operations**: Commonly used in transaction systems to provide rollback functionality.

### **Additional Notes**
The Memento Pattern is ideal when you need to preserve an object's state but must ensure the details of how the state is saved remain encapsulated within the object itself. However, careful management of memory and resources is essential to avoid performance issues.
