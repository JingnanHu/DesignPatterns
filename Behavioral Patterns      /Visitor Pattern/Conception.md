The **Visitor Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that separates an algorithm from the objects it operates on, allowing you to add new operations to an object structure without modifying its classes.

### Key Concepts
- **Core Idea**: Each object in a structure accepts a visitor object. The visitor performs operations on these objects.
- **Benefits**: Enables adding new operations without altering the object structure.
- **Main Roles**:
    - **Visitor**: Defines operations to be performed on each type of object.
    - **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the specific operations.
    - **Element**: Defines an `accept` method to allow visitors.
    - **ConcreteElement**: Implements the `accept` method to call the visitor's operation.
    - **Object Structure**: A collection of elements that the visitor can traverse.

### Example
Think of a museum where a guide (visitor) interacts differently with exhibits (elements). Instead of changing the exhibits, the guide provides different interpretations or information.
