The **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used to allow a request to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or passes it along to the next handler in the chain. This pattern helps decouple senders and receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle a request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it.

### Key Concepts:
- **Handler**: A handler is an abstract class or interface that defines the method to process a request. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or forwards it to the next handler.
- **Concrete Handlers**: These are classes that implement the handler interface and define the actual processing logic for a specific type of request.
- **Client**: The client sends a request to the first handler in the chain. The client does not need to know which handler will process the request.
- **Request**: The object that is passed along the chain to be processed.

### Structure:
1. **Handler**: This class or interface defines the method to handle the request and a reference to the next handler.
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Implements the handling logic for the specific request.
3. **Client**: Sends the request to the first handler in the chain.

### Example:

Letâ€™s take the example of a system where we need to handle various log levels (like "Error", "Info", and "Debug"):

```java
abstract class LogHandler {
    protected LogHandler nextHandler;

    public LogHandler(LogHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    public abstract void handleLog(String message, String level);
}

class FileLogHandler extends LogHandler {
    public FileLogHandler(LogHandler nextHandler) {
        super(nextHandler);
    }

    @Override
    public void handleLog(String message, String level) {
        if ("Error".equals(level)) {
            System.out.println("[File] Error: " + message);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleLog(message, level);
        }
    }
}

class ConsoleLogHandler extends LogHandler {
    public ConsoleLogHandler(LogHandler nextHandler) {
        super(nextHandler);
    }

    @Override
    public void handleLog(String message, String level) {
        if ("Info".equals(level)) {
            System.out.println("[Console] Info: " + message);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleLog(message, level);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LogHandler fileHandler = new FileLogHandler(null);  // Last handler, does not pass the request
        LogHandler consoleHandler = new ConsoleLogHandler(fileHandler);  // Passes to FileLogHandler if not handled

        consoleHandler.handleLog("An error occurred", "Error");
        consoleHandler.handleLog("Informational message", "Info");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **LogHandler**: This is the base handler that contains a reference to the next handler (`nextHandler`). It defines the `handleLog` method, which can be overridden by concrete handlers.
2. **FileLogHandler**: This is a concrete handler that handles "Error" logs. If it cannot handle the log (because it's not an "Error"), it passes it along to the next handler in the chain.
3. **ConsoleLogHandler**: This is another concrete handler that handles "Info" logs. If it can't handle the log, it passes the request to `FileLogHandler`.

### Advantages of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
1. **Decoupling of Sender and Receiver**: The client does not know which handler will process the request, and handlers are unaware of which handler will process it next.
2. **Flexibility**: You can easily add or remove handlers in the chain without modifying the clients or other handlers.
3. **Simplified Code**: The code is simplified by allowing multiple objects to handle a request, instead of needing to create complex conditional structures.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Potential Unhandled Requests**: If no handler in the chain is able to handle the request, it will be passed along the chain without being processed, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. **Chain Traversal Cost**: If the chain is long and many handlers are involved, the request might have to traverse through many objects before being handled.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is commonly used in scenarios like logging systems, event handling, and request processing systems.
