### **Template Method Pattern**

The **Template Method Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It ensures that the overall process or sequence of steps is preserved, while allowing flexibility in the details.

### **Key Features**

1. **Algorithm Structure**  
   The base class provides a template method that outlines the steps of the algorithm. Some of these steps are implemented in the base class, while others are defined as abstract or optional (hook methods) and are implemented or overridden by subclasses.

2. **Code Reuse**  
   Common behavior is centralized in the base class, reducing redundancy. Subclasses only need to provide implementation for specific, varying parts.

3. **Final Template Method**  
   The template method is often marked as `final` (e.g., in Java) to prevent subclasses from modifying the algorithm's structure.

### **Components of the Template Method Pattern**

1. **Abstract Class**
    - Defines the template method.
    - Implements common steps of the algorithm.
    - Declares abstract methods for steps that subclasses must implement.

2. **Concrete Class (Subclass)**
    - Implements or overrides the abstract methods defined in the base class.
    - Customizes specific steps of the algorithm.

### **Example in Java**

```java
abstract class Game {
    // Template Method
    public final void play() {
        initialize();
        startPlay();
        endPlay();
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    abstract void initialize();
    abstract void startPlay();
    abstract void endPlay();
}

class Football extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Football Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Football Game Started. Enjoy the game!");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Football Game Finished!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Football();
        game.play(); // Executes the template method
    }
}
```

---

### **Output Example**

When the `play()` method is called:
```
Football Game Initialized! Start playing.
Football Game Started. Enjoy the game!
Football Game Finished!
```

---

### **Benefits**

1. **Consistency**  
   The template method ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across all subclasses.

2. **Code Reuse**  
   Common steps are implemented once in the base class and reused by all subclasses.

3. **Flexibility**  
   Subclasses can customize specific steps of the algorithm without altering its overall structure.

---

### **Real-World Examples**

1. **Frameworks and Libraries**  
   Many frameworks use template methods to define workflows. For example:
    - In UI frameworks, base classes may define the lifecycle of components (e.g., `onCreate()`, `onStart()` in Android).

2. **File Processing**  
   A base class might define a template for reading, processing, and writing files, leaving the processing logic to subclasses.

---

### **Summary**

The Template Method Pattern is ideal for scenarios where the overall structure of an algorithm is fixed, but individual steps vary across different implementations. It promotes code reuse, consistency, and clear separation of responsibilities.
