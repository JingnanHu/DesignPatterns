### Strategy Pattern (Behavioral Design Pattern)

The **Strategy Pattern** is a design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern enables the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. Itâ€™s commonly used when multiple classes differ only in their behavior and you want to dynamically switch between these behaviors.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Context**:
    - The class that uses a `Strategy` to perform its task.
    - Delegates the algorithm or behavior to a `Strategy` object.

2. **Strategy Interface**:
    - Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms or behaviors.
    - Allows the `Context` to interact with different strategies uniformly.

3. **Concrete Strategy**:
    - Implements the `Strategy` interface.
    - Each `Concrete Strategy` represents a different algorithm or behavior.

#### Advantages
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Strategies can be added or modified without changing the `Context` class.
- **Code Reusability**: Encapsulation of algorithms makes the code modular and reusable.
- **Eliminates Conditional Logic**: Avoids heavy use of `if-else` or `switch` statements by delegating behavior to concrete strategies.

### When to Use the Strategy Pattern
1. You have multiple algorithms or behaviors for a task, and they need to be interchangeable.
2. You want to eliminate `if-else` or `switch` conditions for selecting algorithms.
3. You want to make the behavior of a class configurable at runtime.

This pattern is particularly useful in applications like payment processing, data formatting, or game AI where behaviors change frequently.
